Sales forecasting is an important factor in the retail sector, which affects decisions about staff, marketing, and inventory. Big companies like Walmart utilize sales forecasting to run their business efficiently and with a focus on the needs of their customers.This extensive dataset from Walmart spans the years 2010 to 2012 and includes weekly sales data as well as details on holidays, unusual temperatures, and other local weather-related anomalies across all US retail locations. Time series analysis is crucial for predicting future values from historical data.It is not easy to forecast the sales based only on experience.However,Forecasting has advanced significantly when machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques are used for sales prediction.Our goal is to evaluate the variations in Walmart predictions between the deep learning algorithm LSTM, the statistical model ARIMA, and the prophet model.This repository contains processing the sales data, train the models and evaluating the results.After comparing the results more regressors are added with the best model to know how they affect the accuracy of the model.
